Feasible Offline Enhancements:
User Interface and Deployment:

Web/Desktop GUI (e.g., using Streamlit or Tkinter for a local interface).
Packaging and Distribution (e.g., standalone installers or Docker containers for local deployment).
Security and Compliance:

Authentication and Access Control (local user accounts or file-based permissions).
Encryption and Auditing (local data encryption and log files).
Offline Enforcement (built-in checks to block any network attempts).
Scalability and Performance:

Database Integration (local databases like SQLite for storage).
Multi-User and Concurrency (local session management and async processing).
Model Optimization (quantized models or GPU use on local hardware).
Advanced Features:

Multi-Modal Support (e.g., OCR for images in PDFs using bundled libraries).
Query Enhancements (local NLP for summarization or history, using offline models).
Integration APIs (local REST APIs for internal tools, without external calls).
Analytics and Monitoring (local metrics and dashboards).
Business and Monetization:

Customization Options (local plugins or configs).
Licensing (local license checks).
Testing and Documentation (local unit tests and manuals).
