abstract: >-
  CUBO is a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for 
  local, privacy-preserving document intelligence. It features hybrid retrieval (BM25 + 
  dense embeddings), reranking with ColBERT, sentence window chunking, and advanced 
  ingestion pipelines for PDFs, CSVs, and Excel files. The system is optimized for 
  consumer-grade hardware (32GB RAM, RTX 4050) and supports both desktop GUI and web 
  API interfaces.
